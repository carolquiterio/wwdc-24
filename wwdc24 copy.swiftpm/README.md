# Shaping

## Hello! My name is Carolina Quiterio and I'm an Apple Developer Academy student passionate about technology and iOS development in Brazil.

## About my idea

Since I was a child, I have lived in the same house as my grandmother, Therezinha. We have always been very close, and I loved spending time at home with her. However, as the years went by, she began to experience significant degradation in her vision, especially in her ability to distinguish colors. It was very sad to see her struggling to see, so I always tried to help her.

Because of this, I decided to combine three things that I love: 1. Accessilibity; 2. Technology; and 3. iOS
I then created Shaping, a Playground App written in Swift that tells the story of Green and Red, characters that explain about color-blindness and create a color machine to help people differentiate this colors. I made this Playground to help people, like my grandmother, have the opportunity to differentiate green and red color with more autonomy.

Shapings goal is to help people around the world in their daily lives.

## How to run

- The app was designed to run on iPhone 13/14/15, on a phisic device - because phisic devices have the camera and the Metal. - Which are necessary for the best app experience. Also, the images feature is only available for the iOS 17.0 or later.

#Technology
To make Shaping I used Swift, SwiftUI, Metal and UIKit. 

Before this playground, I had no knowledge in Metal and UIKit. It was amazing to discover and try them - now I love Metal.
